# Skill Overview and Purpose

# Jira Test Documentation Generator

## Overview
The jira-test-doc skill automatically generates QA-friendly test documentation from Jira tickets and their related Git commits. It bridges the gap between technical implementation and QA testing by translating code changes into actionable test scenarios.

## Purpose
This skill helps developers:
- Generate comprehensive test documentation from Jira tickets
- Translate technical commits into business-friendly language
- Create concrete test scenarios for QA teams
- Automatically post documentation as Jira comments
- Save time documenting changes for QA review

## Design Philosophy
The skill focuses on WHAT changed from a user's perspective, not HOW it was implemented technically. It avoids jargon and uses plain language that QA teams and stakeholders can understand.
